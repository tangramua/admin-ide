# React Shared Components


This package is to provide components which are

1. Uses multiple packages from `packages-module` to form a composite compoennt. For example, if we write a component that is dependent on `account-api` and `git-api`, since it depends on two package's graphql generated code, we can add that component here.

2. Components that are used multiple times between `packages-modules` and which are generic and don't belong to any of the module can be placed here.
